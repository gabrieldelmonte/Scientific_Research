//! The GPIO module.
//!
//! The BeagleBone Black has 65 GPIO pins, many of which are enabled by the
//! default device tree overlay.
//! However, these pins may need to be explicitly configured as GPIOs by using
//! the `config-pin` command.
//!
//! As an example, use the following command to set GPIO 29 :
//! `sudo config-pin P9.22 gpio"`
//! The above example configure the 22nd pin on P9 (the second header), also
//! known as GPIO_2, as a GPIO.
//! This command works for recent kernel versions.

//! If you wish to configure another pin as a GPIO, substitute it's identifier
//! for P9.22.
//! A convenient list of pin identifiers can be found through an online search
//! of "BeagleBone pinout".
//!
//! Note: not all pins are available to be set as GPIOs with the default device
//! tree overlay, as they are used for other interfaces such as HDMI.
//! You may need to change the overlay from the default to access these blocked
//! pins.
